Release notes for Flumotion 0.3.1 "La Merce"
        

The Flumotion team is happy to announce
a new development release of the
unstable 0.3 branch
of the Flumotion Streaming Server.

This branch will lead up to the stable 0.4 series.  It is not yet meant
for production purposes.  People who want to run a stable Flumotion
should stick to the 0.2 releases, or wait for the 0.4 releases.

Flumotion is a streaming server for GNU/Linux
systems featuring an easy to use configuration and administration GUI. 
Implemented using GStreamer as the processing backend and using python and
Twisted for the high-level operations and GUI, it combines a wide feature set
with ease of use.
