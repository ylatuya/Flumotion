Release notes for Flumotion 0.5.2 "Can Tomas"

The Flumotion team proudly announces
a new release of the development 0.5 branch
of the Flumotion Streaming Server.

Flumotion is a streaming media server created with the backing of
Fluendo. It features intuitive graphical administration tools, making
the task of setting up and manipulating audio and video streams easy for
even novice system administrators. Flumotion is released under the GPL.


Overview

After the winter release that was bursting with features and changes,
it was time to shift the development focus more towards stabilizing our
software and improving the user experience.

The wizard has been completely re-written to modestly just work and
not get in your way. The GTK+ admin interface has received a number of
improvements. One new component has been added and we didn't forget
about the existing ones, either.

Below is a summary of user-visible features. A full list of all closed
tickets can be found at the end of this announcement.  Existing
Flumotion users are strongly encouraged to upgrade and report on your
experiences. If you haven't yet tried Flumotion, now is a great time
to start!


Features of this release

      * The wizard has been re-written completely.
        Forward, back, and random access navigation through the wizard
        pages should now work better. There is now an option to
        automatically serve Cortado in a web page. A shoutcast
        consumer has been added. The wizard queries the manager for
        capabilities, allowing add-on projects to plug in different
        components and wizard pages into the wizard for producers,
        encoders and consumers.

      * The GTK+ admin now offers a new tab in the component view
        providing information about the component's process (uptime,
        CPU usage, virtual memory size, etc.); tooltips have been
        added to a number of UI elements and also the status bar
        provides more information.

      * A debug option has been created that hides the scary debug
        parts for the average user, but at the same time allows more
        debugging power for the less easily scared users.  It now
        allows setting log levels for GStreamer and Flumotion on the
        fly per component.

      * New Dirac encoding component (also supported directly in the
        wizard)!

      * The HTTP server component can limit the bitrate at which it
        serves files and can also be easily set-up to serve Cortado
        applets with the supporting HTML and JavaScript files.

      * The FireWire producer allows selecting devices by GUID - now
        it's possible to specify one of the connected devices, or even
        use multiple devices if they are connected to different buses.


Known issues

      * The set of switch components don't currently work due to an
        issue with the underlying input-selector GStreamer element.

      * The overlay and composite components may generate many gst
        CRITICAL log messages with the recent versions of GStreamer -
        it is superficial and shouldn't affect their work.
