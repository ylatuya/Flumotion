Release notes for Flumotion 0.5.4 "EAT"

The Flumotion team announces
a new release of the development 0.5 branch
of the Flumotion Streaming Server.

Flumotion is a streaming media server created with the backing of
Fluendo. It features intuitive graphical administration tools, making
the task of setting up and manipulating audio and video streams easy for
even novice system administrators. Flumotion is released under the GPL.


Overview

Yet another step in the long march towards a stable release. We made
sure we close more bugs than we create, hence the scarce features and
numerous fixes.

The bulk of the improvements is centered around the administration
interface. The configuration assistant gained in functionality,
stability and consistency.

Below is the summary of the user-visible changes and occasional
features that we managed to slip in. Users of previous versions are
strongly encouraged to upgrade to "EAT", which we believe to be more
predictable and better tested.


Features of this release

      * You can now configure your ondemand flows to force displaying
        a file download dialog when the user browses to the media URL,
        instead of relying on the web browser handling of the file.

      * The assistant displays more precise and user-friendly
        messages and is more thorough in checking for the correct
        working environment for your flow. It's also capable of
        presenting a list of connected FireWire cameras allowing
        you to choose any of them.


Known issues

      * The overlay component continues to be broken. The
        regression introduced in gstreamer-plugins-good version 0.10.10 is
        still present, we hope to be able to fix it before the next
        Flumotion release.
