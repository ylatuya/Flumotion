Release notes for Flumotion 0.4.2 "Belchica Strikes Back"
        

The Flumotion team is happy to announce
a new release of the
stable 0.4 branch
of the Flumotion Streaming Server.

Flumotion is a streaming server for GNU/Linux
systems featuring an easy to use configuration and administration GUI. 
Implemented using GStreamer as the processing backend and using python and
Twisted for the high-level operations and GUI, it combines a wide feature set
with ease of use.

  
Features of this release
    
      * Full support for running under Python 2.5
      * The GTK admin can now start a manager and worker for you automatically
      * Messages now have timestamps to allow better diagnosis of failures
      * Improvements for service scripts to allow better recovery from failure states
      * With sufficiently recent GStreamer, components now provide much more information about errors in the data stream
      * Error resilience is drastically improved compared to older versions
