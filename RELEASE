Release notes for Flumotion 0.3.2 "Flight JL 412"
        

The Flumotion team is happy to announce
a new development release of the
unstable 0.3 branch
of the Flumotion Streaming Server.

This branch will lead up to the stable 0.4 series.  It is not yet meant
for production purposes.  People who want to run a stable Flumotion
should stick to the 0.2 releases, or wait for the 0.4 releases.

Flumotion is a streaming server for GNU/Linux
systems featuring an easy to use configuration and administration GUI. 
Implemented using GStreamer as the processing backend and using python and
Twisted for the high-level operations and GUI, it combines a wide feature set
with ease of use.

  
Features of this release
    
      * Greatly improved and more flexible http burst-on-connect
      * Allow setting a maximum duration for http connections
      * Add simple icecast-stream relaying component
      * Add component that takes GDP-payloaded data from a unix socket
      * ICal based bouncer, to specify that clients may only connect during a 
        specific time of day
      * Restarting a manager while a flow is running now works reliably
      * The disker component can now be remotely controlled to start/stop 
        recording, and to automatically maintain symlinks to the latest 
        recording
      * Many component propertiess were renamed to make them more consistent
      * The http-server component is now more reliable, and has GTK UI
      * Components in the GTK UI now show information about their feeders
      * Network clock synchronisation now works in more cases
      * Workers and their jobs can now have their logs rotated

Bugs fixed in this release
    
      * 50 : when modules get renamed, and you do a new make install, you end 
             up with two components of the same name
      * 88 : automatically restart workers on connection trouble
      * 89 : possibility for external (software) sources.
      * 131 : a manager restart with a running worker config causes worker to 
              lose its old children that get overwritten with new info
      * 232 : go over all component properties in registry and unify naming
      * 298 : Changing to a different connection and failing leaves the UI in 
              a grayed-out state
      * 315 : stopping all and starting all makes all components sad
      * 352 : theora encoder uses bitrate in kbit/sec, unlike most other 
              encoders
      * 411 : result of <debug></port>
      * 412 : Restarting a manager doesn't work properly
      * 414 : flumotion-admin's name lookup doesn't always work correctly
      * 438 : core dump by flumotion-job
      * 440 : flow with an audio-source fails
      * 441 : looper component stays waking forever if file does not exist
      * 449 : workers that have their port range specified as x-x (to use only 
              one port) make things go wrong
      * 454 : reconnect when upstream components restart causes a bad stream, 
              gdp issue
      * 462 : Burst-on-connect by time
      * 471 : empty .connections file breaks the greeter, creating a gtk.Label 
              instead of the custom Connections
      * 477 : we seem to be leaking file descriptors on reconnect
      * 479 : leak in feedserver
      * 480 : after component that is clock master reconnects, it is told to 
              be a clock master again
      * 481 : merge mike-http-improvements-1 
      * 484 : worker does not create job for a sleeping component that has a 
              moodPending, also moodPending should get reset when stopping a 
              sad or lost component 
      * 485 : add ability to stop recording to a disker
      * 486 : disker should allow schedulable recordings
      * 502 : make sure log rotation works both in the manager and in workers
      * 507 : feed components should track information of the eaters connected 
              to them
      * 510 : every reconnect causes a new feeder to be added in UI for 
              "plumbing"
      * 513 : The BaseAdminGtkNode don't have setitem and delitem vmethod
      * 515 : The Plumbing GtkNode is alway instantiated and failed when the 
              component is not a FeedComponent
      * 518 : Admin prints tracebacks for non-feed-components
      * 519 : tracebacks in  admin when  stopping a component
      * 524 : disker admin UI bug
      * 525 : When the audiotest component admin interface is loaded it set 
              the frequency to 1 making it "silent"
      * 530 : admin's open connection, quit, and about menu items appear as 
              gtk-open, etc
      * 531 : flumotion-admin screws the pooch if it can't connect to the 
              manager
