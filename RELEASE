Release notes for Flumotion 0.5.3 "Ovella Negra"

The Flumotion team announces
a new release of the development 0.5 branch
of the Flumotion Streaming Server.

Flumotion is a streaming media server created with the backing of
Fluendo. It features intuitive graphical administration tools, making
the task of setting up and manipulating audio and video streams easy for
even novice system administrators. Flumotion is released under the GPL.


Overview

This is another release bringing us closer towards the end of the 0.5
development cycle. We continued focusing mostly on stabilising and
cleaning up the internals and the list of fixed bugs is once again
much longer than the list of features.

The most noticeable changes happened in the assistant (a.k.a wizard)
and the admin interface. They are integrated more closely, the
assistant covers more of the available Flumotion functionality and
they both offer easier access to the documentation.

Below is a summary of the user-visible features followed by a full
list of all closed tickets. And as always, we strongly encourage
existing Flumotion users to upgrade and report on your experiences!


Features of this release

      * The assistant now provides help with setting up on-demand
        services. It can also assist users in adding more encoding
        formats to existing flows.

      * A new consumer component (gdp-consumer) has been added, the
        HTTP consumer components can write statistics directly to RRD
        files and the http-server component is now able to maintain a
        cache of streamed files.

      * Some lower-level tools were improved, and some were added,
        including validators for flow, config and registry files and
        command-line utilities for controlling the different processes
        of Flumotion.


Known issues

      * Due to a bug in gst-python since version 0.10.11, the looper
        component might occasionally crash. Until the fix is released
        using an older version of gst-python might be an option.

      * Also a regression has been introduced in
        gstreamer-plugins-good version 0.10.10 that causes the
        overlay component to produce no overlay on the video.
        We anticipate that it will get fixed in the next release of
        gstreamer-plugins-good.
