Release notes for Flumotion 0.6.0 "Can Punyetes"
        
The Flumotion team announces
a new release of the stable 0.6 branch
of the Flumotion Streaming Server.

Flumotion is a streaming media server created with the backing of
Fluendo. It features intuitive graphical administration tools, making
the task of setting up and manipulating audio and video streams easy for
even novice system administrators. Flumotion is released under the GPL.


Overview

After two and a half years from the start of the stable 0.4 branch and after
more than two years from the latest stable release we are crazily proud to
announce the start of a new stable series.

The differences from the last release in the 0.5 development branch are mostly
bugfixes, last cleanups and tying up loose ends. The assistant got further
polished, test coverage got increased and nasty bugs were squashed.

On the other hand you will find quite a few new features in this release,
ranging from improvements in the user interface to new possibilities for the
streaming server administrators and developers to completely new functionality
that Flumotion can now provide.

Below is the summary of the user-visible changes from the last development
release codenamed "EAT". From this point new features will only be added and
released in the new 0.7 development series. The stable branch will get bugfixes
however.


Features of this release

      * Added Python 2.6 compatibility. Dropped Python 2.3 compatibility. You
        can see we are going in the right direction.

      * The icecast producer component will now automatically retry
        connecting to the icecast server in case of connection loss.

      * The playlist producer component got a shiny new user interface
        visible in the GTK administration tool.

      * A new plug for the HTTP server component has been added that makes it
        possible to configure the bitrate control plug on a file by file
        basis. This can be used to implement per file bitrate control.

      * The porter now injects a HTTP GET parameter named FLUREQUID for each
        connection it passes to the slaved component. The parameter is unique
        for each connection the porter handles, so you can use it to track the
        lifecycle of a request across various components.

      * Flumotion jobs can now be automatically run under a profiler if the
        environment in which the worker is started includes a FLU_PROFILE or
        FLU_BUILTIN_PROFILE variable. The former uses a statistical profiler
        from http://wingolog.org/pub/statprof.py, the latter uses the builtin
        Python profiler.

      * Flumotion HTTP server component can now perform remote seeking with
        MP4 files, similar to Apache with mod_h264_streaming. When handling
        requests for MP4 files that include a HTTP GET parameter named start it
        will serve the file from a time offset specified by that
        parameter. This protocol is supported by popular open-source Flash
        players. The feature requires a supporting Python library from
        http://github.com/arkadini/mp4seek

      * The assistant now offers the possibility to choose static OGG files as
        video or audio sources and creates flows with the looper component if
        you choose it.


Known issues

      * The Ogg muxer in GStreamer started misbehaving in version 0.10.24 of
        gst-plugins-base. This regression has been found and fixed and the fix
        will be included in version 0.10.25. Unfortunately if you are using
        gst-plugins-base 0.10.24, your Ogg flows will not work. We strongly
        urge users to use a previous release of gst-plugins-base and upgrade to
        0.10.25 as soon as it is released. A warning message will be visible in
        the administration UI if Flumotion detects that you are using an
        affected version of gst-plugins-good.

      * The Dirac encoder element in current GStreamer has some issues when
        combined with the Ogg muxer. Setting up a Dirac flow might result in
        the streamer component staying hungry regardless of the muxer going
        happy. We are working on the issue and hope to have it resolved in the
        upcoming GStreamer release.

      * The multipart muxer element in GStreamer can sometimes produce
        unplayable output. Setting up a multipart encoded mulaw flow can result in
        unplayable output. We hope this will also be fixed in the next
        GStreamer release.
