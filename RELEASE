Release notes for Flumotion 0.4.0 "Camp Nou"
        

The Flumotion team is happy to announce
a new release of the
stable 0.4 branch
of the Flumotion Streaming Server.

Flumotion is a streaming server for GNU/Linux
systems featuring an easy to use configuration and administration GUI. 
Implemented using GStreamer as the processing backend and using python and
Twisted for the high-level operations and GUI, it combines a wide feature set
with ease of use.
