Code
====

The style of all python code should honor the recommendations in the
Style Guide for Python Code [1] document with the following exceptions:

* It's okay to have more than 79 characters _if it makes sense_, we 
  don't live in the 70ies any longer and can therefor use more
  characters per line. 

* TODO

ChangeLog
=========

All checkins should add an appropriate entry in the ChangeLog.
Exceptions for repository ignore files and metadata.


Tests
=====

To be able to archive good quality of the code, all major checkins
should also add an appropriate test in the testsuite. It's not okay
to have any tests in a non-working tests when checking in. The testsuite
should *always* run with no failing tests and ideally with no output.
This also makes it easier to refactor code.
If large changes are made over many places in the tree which can't make
the whole testsuite run, then it should be made on a separate branch and
not be merged with the maintrunk before everything passes and it has been
reviewed.
