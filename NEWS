This is Flumotion 0.5.3 "Ovella Negra"

Features since 0.5.2:

  * The assistant now provides help with setting up on-demand
    services. It can also assist users in adding more encoding formats
    to existing flows.

  * A new consumer component (gdp-consumer) has been added, the HTTP
    consumer components can write statistics directly to RRD files and
    the http-server component is now able to maintain a cache of
    streamed files.

  * Some lower-level tools were improved, and some were added,
    including validators for flow, config and registry files and
    command-line utilities for controlling the different processes of
    Flumotion.

Features since 0.5.1:

  * The wizard has been re-written completely.  Forward, back, and
    random access navigation through the wizard pages should now work
    better. There is now an option to automatically serve Cortado in a
    web page. A shoutcast consumer has been added. The wizard queries
    the manager for capabilities, allowing add-on projects to plug in
    different components and wizard pages into the wizard for
    producers, encoders and consumers.

  * The GTK+ admin now offers a new tab in the component view
    providing information about the component's process (uptime, CPU
    usage, virtual memory size, etc.); tooltips have been added to a
    number of UI elements and also the status bar provides more
    information.

  * A debug option has been created that hides the scary debug parts
    for the average user, but at the same time allows more debugging
    power for the less easily scared users.  It now allows setting log
    levels for GStreamer and Flumotion on the fly per component.

  * New Dirac encoding component (also supported directly in the
    wizard)!

  * The HTTP server component can limit the bitrate at which it serves
    files and can also be easily set-up to serve Cortado applets with
    the supporting HTML and JavaScript files.

  * The FireWire producer allows selecting devices by GUID - now it's
    possible to specify one of the connected devices, or even use
    multiple devices if they are connected to different buses.

Features since 0.4.2:

  * Much more robust and efficient protocol between manager and
    component. It is now impossible to get a component in a "stuck"
    state. The manager's code was dramatically simplified,
    decreasing manager CPU usage when many components decide to
    reconnect at once.

  * A feed may be provided by more than one component. If one
    component providing a feed goes away, and another component is
    available for that feed, the manager will reconnect downstream
    components, providing redundancy and failover.

  * New components! Use Flumotion as a source to Icecast streamers
    with the shout2-consumer component, thanks to Gergely Nagy. Make
    picture-in-picture streams with composite-combiner. Dynamically
    switch between different feeds with the various switch
    components. The switch may occur manually, or automatically
    based on data flow or on a schedule expressed in an ical file.
    Use GNonLin to stream a dynamically-reschedulable sequence of
    files with playlist-producer. Broadcast your screen with
    screencast-producer, data from an IP camera with rtsp-producer,
    or live MPEG captures with ivtv-producer. Finally you can limit
    access to a manager or to a stream by IP with the ip-bouncer.
    Good times! See the output of flumotion-inspect for more
    information.

  * Improved components! You can now capture the raw DV from a
    firewire-producer. The webcam component supports V4L2, and HTTP
    streamers finally implement bandwidth limiting. You can now
    tweak the theora encoding parameters (there's even an interface
    for it in the wizard), and the on-demand HTTP streamer better
    supports Flash video seeking. Finally, we now have per-channel
    volume meters for audio sources in the GTK+ admin.

  * Faster component startup. Components no longer parse the
    registry, which greatly improves component startup time. In
    addition, the manager-component protocol revisions reduce the
    number of remote calls needed for a component to go happy.

  * A comprehensive reduction of Flumotion's memory footprint. In a
    still-ongoing effort, we have reduced memory usage by 20 percent
    or more in all processes. In addition, via revising how we
    handle authentication credentials, we have plugged all known
    memory leaks.

  * The amount of steady-state network chitchat between components
    and admins was reduced. Admins will only receive CPU usage
    updates from components if they subscribe to updates.

  * Detailed statistics and diagnostics of the state of data flow
    in a component can now be viewed from the GTK+ administration
    interface.

  * Better informational messages for debugging misconfigured
    components. These messages show up in the GTK+ admin. Also, the
    manager's "export configuration" feature works much more
    reliably now.

  * HAL integration for allowing Flumotion access to media devices.
    No more chmod a+rw /dev/raw1394!

  * Better debugging and programmatic interfaces to the Flumotion
    system, with the addition of manhole support (SSH into your
    manager!), improvements to flumotion-command, Nagios
    integration, a tool for logging UIState keys to an RRD file, and
    more. Admit it, the part about "and more" piqued your curiosity.

484     worker does not create job for a sleeping component that has a
        moodPending, also moodPending should get reset when stopping a sad or
        lost component
485     add ability to stop recording to a disker
486     disker should allow schedulable recordings
502     make sure log rotation works both in the manager and in workers
507     feed components should track information of the eaters connected to them
510     every reconnect causes a new feeder to be added in UI for "plumbing"
513     The BaseAdminGtkNode don't have setitem and delitem vmethod
515     The Plumbing GtkNode is alway instantiated and failed when the
        component is not a FeedComponent
518     Admin prints tracebacks for non-feed-components
519     tracebacks in  admin when  stopping a component
524     disker admin UI bug
525     When the audiotest component admin interface is loaded it set the
        frequency to 1 making it "silent"
530     admin's open connection, quit, and about menu items appear as gtk-open,
        etc
531     flumotion-admin screws the pooch if it can't connect to the manager

Features since 0.2.2:

- dropped support for GStreamer 0.10
- dropped support for Twisted 1.3.0
- workers only expose one TCP port for feeds now
- porter component allows sharing one TCP port for all streamers
- added plugs and sockets for finer-grained extensibility
- added a static file serving component
- workers and jobs reconnect on network failures
- components reconnect feeds on network failures
- added integration test framework

Bugs fixed since 0.2.2:

- 327 : Clock slaves can start up before the clock provider
- 332 : Patch for valgrinding jobs
- 359 : Components that fail to start can't be restarted later

Features since 0.1.10:

- Fully works with GStreamer 0.10
- a looper element that can create a live stream out of an Ogg/Theora+Vorbis
  file (GStreamer 0.10 only)
- Component protocol cleanups, making it a lot easier to write new components.
  Also fixes a set of bugs where a component ran into an error and can't be
  restarted.
- synchronization between capturing components (if they can directly contact
  each other over UDP).  Should properly synchronize webcams and soundcards.
- Flumotion now supports add-on projects, that can be discovered even when
  uninstalled, using the FLU_PROJECT_PATH environment variable.
- Added flumotion-command, a simple admin client that can execute certain
  commands on components.  Useful for getting statistics, rotating log files,
  ...
- Show what worker a component is supposed to start on.
- Components can now send fully translatable messages as part of their state.
  The translations happens in the admin client, in the admin's locale.
  These messages are now visible in the admin and tell you more about why
  a component is sad.
