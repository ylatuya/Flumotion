50      when modules get renamed, and you do a new make install, you end up

88      automatically restart workers on connection trouble
89      possibility for external (software) sources.
131     a manager restart with a running worker config causes worker to lose 
        its old children that get overwritten with new info
232     go over all component properties in registry and unify naming
298     Changing to a different connection and failing leaves the UI in a

        issue
462     Burst-on-connect by time
471     empty .connections file breaks the greeter, creating a gtk.Label 
        instead of the custom Connections

479     leak in feedserver
480     after component that is clock master reconnects, it is told to be a 
        clock master again
481     merge mike-http-improvements-1
484     worker does not create job for a sleeping component that has a 
        moodPending, also moodPending should get reset when stopping a sad or 
        lost component

486     disker should allow schedulable recordings
502     make sure log rotation works both in the manager and in workers

        etc
531     flumotion-admin screws the pooch if it can't connect to the manager

Features since 0.2.2:

- dropped support for GStreamer 0.10
- dropped support for Twisted 1.3.0
- workers only expose one TCP port for feeds now
- porter component allows sharing one TCP port for all streamers
- added plugs and sockets for finer-grained extensibility
- added a static file serving component
- workers and jobs reconnect on network failures
- components reconnect feeds on network failures
- added integration test framework

Bugs fixed since 0.2.2:

- 327 : Clock slaves can start up before the clock provider
- 332 : Patch for valgrinding jobs
- 359 : Components that fail to start can't be restarted later

Features since 0.1.10:

- Fully works with GStreamer 0.10
- a looper element that can create a live stream out of an Ogg/Theora+Vorbis
  file (GStreamer 0.10 only)
- Component protocol cleanups, making it a lot easier to write new components.
  Also fixes a set of bugs where a component ran into an error and can't be
  restarted.
- synchronization between capturing components (if they can directly contact
  each other over UDP).  Should properly synchronize webcams and soundcards.
- Flumotion now supports add-on projects, that can be discovered even when
  uninstalled, using the FLU_PROJECT_PATH environment variable.
- Added flumotion-command, a simple admin client that can execute certain
  commands on components.  Useful for getting statistics, rotating log files,
  ...
- Show what worker a component is supposed to start on.
- Components can now send fully translatable messages as part of their state.
  The translations happens in the admin client, in the admin's locale.
  These messages are now visible in the admin and tell you more about why
  a component is sad.
