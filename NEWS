This is Flumotion 0.3.1, "La Merce".

IMPORTANT NOTE:

This is an unstable version of Flumotion on the 0.3 development branch.
If you are looking for a stable Flumotion, use one of the 0.2 releases.

Features since 0.2.2:

- dropped support for GStreamer 0.10
- dropped support for Twisted 1.3.0
- workers only expose one TCP port for feeds now
- porter component allows sharing one TCP port for all streamers
- added plugs and sockets for finer-grained extensibility
- added a static file serving component
- workers and jobs reconnect on network failures
- components reconnect feeds on network failures
- added integration test framework

Bugs fixed since 0.2.2:

- 327 : Clock slaves can start up before the clock provider
- 332 : Patch for valgrinding jobs
- 359 : Components that fail to start can't be restarted later

Features since 0.1.10:

- Fully works with GStreamer 0.10
- a looper element that can create a live stream out of an Ogg/Theora+Vorbis
  file (GStreamer 0.10 only)
- Component protocol cleanups, making it a lot easier to write new components.
  Also fixes a set of bugs where a component ran into an error and can't be
  restarted.
- synchronization between capturing components (if they can directly contact
  each other over UDP).  Should properly synchronize webcams and soundcards.
- Flumotion now supports add-on projects, that can be discovered even when
  uninstalled, using the FLU_PROJECT_PATH environment variable.
- Added flumotion-command, a simple admin client that can execute certain
  commands on components.  Useful for getting statistics, rotating log files,
  ...
- Show what worker a component is supposed to start on.
- Components can now send fully translatable messages as part of their state.
  The translations happens in the admin client, in the admin's locale.
  These messages are now visible in the admin and tell you more about why
  a component is sad.
