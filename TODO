* EASY		deprecate <source> tag and require base= attribute to <comp>

* EASY		remove file name header line, or at least the commentary

* EASY		rename components, files, ... to be uniform
		(e.g. web-camera -> webcam, ...)

* EASY		remove all old deprecated bundling code everywhere

* EASY		don't throw up the disconnect dialog when exiting admin client

* EASY		remove utils, split up gstutils

* MEDIUM	give useful error messages when there is no network !
		(service network stop and start flumotion and see hang)

* EASY		move muxers in their own dir ?

* MEDIUM:	provide login dialog in flumotion-admin, with user/pass or
		other types,
		and sessions saved

* MEDIUM:	component.component overrides .error and calls reactor.stop(),
	  	this is dangerous, figure that out

* MEDIUM	allow expression of "test component depends on streamer component"

* MEDIUM	implement moods of component:
		- angry: error
		- happy: running
		- hungry/bored: waiting for feeds to start

* EASY:		change rawstring regentry type to string, and make pipelinestring for pipelines which need \n translated to space
* EASY		and force update every minute,
		or when stats are different from last,
	 	in http streamer UI

* MEDIUM	integration with monitoring tools:
		big brother: either:

* HARD		transfer ALL code from manager

* EASY		decide if bouncer's base authenticate method should always
		be overridden and thus raise

* MEDIUM	if you specify a converter with feedname other than default
		and a consumer eating from that feed and change the source
		to the same feedname, it fails.

* MEDIUM	figure out a way to have worker code for wizard checks
		bundled

* MEDIUM	webcams can be I420, YUY2, or others; we should detect this
	  	gst-plugins 0.8.6 will detect automatically since there is a
		new option for autoprobe-fps which we can then use
		use halogen

* MEDIUM	add runtime checks for plugin versions to provide decent
		fallbacks for bugs like this

* HARD		split up source code layout according to bundleability

- API cleanup:

- manager/component.py:
  - create/remove Avatar -> summon/expel
  - work on only name or only component, so there is a clear API distinction
  - name all arguments used in functions that are the same, with the same name
  - rename components to avatars, and rename functions accordingly

- make an executable script/program that makes all required checks and
  outputs a report, has a proper zero or non-zero exit status and 
  can't run forever if things are stuck (times out properly)


http component

- multiple sources
- rate limit
- make an http URL return a 2xx code when it works or a 5xx code
  when it doesn't
- check for StringIO requests instances, which Twisted 1.3.0 implements
