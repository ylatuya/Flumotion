- API cleanup:

- manager/component.py:
  - create/remove Avatar -> summon/expel
  - work on only name or only component, so there is a clear API distinction
  - name all arguments used in functions that are the same, with the same name
  - rename components to avatars, and rename functions accordingly

- make an executable script/program that makes all required checks and
  outputs a report, has a proper zero or non-zero exit status and 
  can't run forever if things are stuck (times out properly)


http component

- multiple sources
- rate limit
- make an http URL return a 2xx code when it works or a 5xx code
  when it doesn't
- check for StringIO requests instances, which Twisted 1.3.0 implements

launcher
- connect to controller

controller
- accept launcher connections and add a protocol to communicate with
  a launcher to start up components
- authentication between components
