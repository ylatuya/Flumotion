Flumotion - a video streaming server.

0.1.0 - "Agua"

REQUIREMENTS
------------

You need:

GStreamer - 0.8.7 or higher
GStreamer plugins - 0.8.5 or higher
PyGTK - 2.4.0 or higher
GStreamer python bindings - 0.7.93 or higher
Twisted - 1.3.0
Python Imaging Library

And depending on what codecs you want to use:

libvorbis 1.0.1 or higher
libogg 1.1 or higher
libtheora 1.0alpha3 or higher

HACKING
-------
You can use jhbuild with the flu.modules and jhbuildrc file provided in misc/

This will set up everything except for Twisted for you from source.

A FIRST TEST
------------
Once everything is built and possibly installed, 
you can try this to start the server:

terminal 1:
  flumotion-manager -v conf/managers/default/planet.xml

terminal 2:
  flumotion-worker -v -u user -p test

terminal 3:
  flumotion-admin -v -u user -p test

  Go through the wizard, choosing defaults.

  Double-click the http component after the wizard has completed

terminal 4:
  gst-launch gnomevfssrc location=http://localhost:8800 ! oggdemux name=mux
             mux. ! { queue ! vorbisdec ! audioconvert ! alsasink }
             mux. ! { queue ! theoradec ! ffmpegcolorspace ! ximagesink }

  (make sure you type all of this on only one command line !)

Alternatively, you can use any theora-enabled network player to see the stream.

terminal 5:
  for a in `seq 1 10`; do ( flumotion-tester http://localhost:8800 & ); done

  This will throw 10 processes with 100 clients each at the server.  Hopefully,
  all of them will return success at the end of their run !
