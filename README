Flumotion - your streaming media server

WHAT IT IS
----------

Flumotion is a streaming media server based on GStreamer and Twisted.

This is the first public release of Flumotion.
It will probably still contain bugs, be difficult to install (since
you need recent dependencies), and cause you some headaches.

On the other hand, when it works and you are capturing your Firewire camera
on one machine, encoding to Theora on a second (with an overlay, of course), 
encoding the audio to Vorbis on a third, muxing to Ogg on a fourth, and then
streaming both audio and video from a fifth, audio only from a sixth,
video only from a seventh, and capturing all three streams to disk from
an eigth, you feel very good about yourself.

And you also have too many computers.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

You need:

GStreamer - 0.8.7 or higher
GStreamer plugins - 0.8.5 or higher
PyGTK - 2.4.0 or higher
GStreamer python bindings - 0.7.93 or higher
Twisted - 1.3.0
Python Imaging Library

And depending on what codecs you want to use:

libvorbis 1.0.1 or higher
libogg 1.1 or higher
libtheora 1.0alpha3 or higher

And if you want to build documentation:

epydoc

A FIRST TEST
------------

Once everything is built and installed,
you can try this to start the server:

terminal 1:
  flumotion-manager -v conf/managers/default/planet.xml

terminal 2:
  flumotion-worker -v -u user -p test

terminal 3:
  flumotion-admin -v -u user -p test

  Go through the wizard, choosing defaults.

  Double-click the http component after the wizard has completed

terminal 4:
  gst-launch gnomevfssrc location=http://localhost:8800 ! oggdemux name=mux
             mux. ! { queue ! vorbisdec ! audioconvert ! alsasink }
             mux. ! { queue ! theoradec ! ffmpegcolorspace ! ximagesink }

  (make sure you type all of this on only one command line !)

Alternatively, you can use any theora-enabled network player to see the stream.

terminal 5:
  for a in `seq 1 10`; do ( flumotion-tester http://localhost:8800 & ); done

  This will throw 10 processes with 100 clients each at the server.  Hopefully,
  all of them will return success at the end of their run !

DOCUMENTATION
-------------

A manual is being written.

Flumotion also comes with API documentation.  You need epydoc to build them.

HACKING
-------

You can use jhbuild with the flu.modules and jhbuildrc file provided in misc/

This will set up everything except for Twisted for you from source.
