# This file implements a generic wizard framework suitable for processes with
# few steps. Processes with 5 or more steps should use something more like the
# wizard in flumotion.wizard, because it has a history-sensitive navigation bar
# as well. For simple processes, this wizard is sufficient.
#
# You will first have to define the steps in your wizard. They are defined by
# subclassing WizardStep. You define the required class variables, the on_next
# method, and optionally the other methods documented in then WizardStep class.
#
# class FirstStep(WizardStep):
#     name = 'first-step'
#     title = 'First step'
#     text = 'Please fill in your bank details below.'
#     next_pages = ['second-step']
#
#     def on_next(self, state):
#         state['bank-account'], self.bank_account_entry.get_text()
#         return '*finished*'
#
# The on_next method is expected to save any relevant information to the state
# object (a dict) and return the name of the next step, or '*finished*' if this
# is the last step.
#
# Besides control flow, the name of the step is also used to load up a glade
# file describing the step's contents. The wizard will look for it as
# WNAME-SNAME.glade, where WNAME is the name of the wizard and SNAME is the name
# of the step. The widget taken will be the direct child of the first toplevel
# window. Each widget in the glade file will be set as an attribute on the
# WizardStep, e.g. bank_account_entry in the example above.
#
# The "text" is shown above the widget created from the glade file. next_pages
# is a list of possible next steps. Before the widget is shown, the is_available
# method will be called on the steps listed in next_pages, and the names of
# those steps that are actually available will be put in the available_pages
# attribute on the current step. This is useful to allow early steps to show
# if a later step is not available, perhaps by desensitizing an option.
#
# Methods other than on_next and is_available are documented in the WizardStep
# class.
#
# To conjure up a new wizard, call Wizard(NAME, FIRST_PAGE_NAME, STEP1,
# STEP2...). NAME is the name of the wizard, for instance 'greeter'. FIRST_PAGE
# is the name of the first page that should be shown, for instance 'first-step'
# in the example above. STEP1... are the WizardStep specialized classes (not
# instances).
