Using the playlist component
----------------------------

- Requires gstreamer core and base cvs, or the upcoming releases (0.10.13 of
  both) and gnonlin cvs (or a future 0.10.9). Either that or an extensive
  patch set.
- Playlist files must not be added until after all the files are available
- Only ogg vorbis/theora files have been tested. Other formats are _not_
  expected to work fully at this time.
- If you need other input file types, you should transcode them before use (and
  thus before adding the playlist file)
- Changing the currently-playing file is not supported.
- Changing existing playlist files has not undergone extensive testing yet.
