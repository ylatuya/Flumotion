This module implements commands with subtrees of commands.

Suggested use in your project (if you are using Subversion):

- create myproject/extern directory
- svn commit myproject/extern
- svn propset svn:externals "command https://thomas.apestaart.org/moap/svn/trunk/moap/extern/command"

Alternatively, you can embed only the command.py file with proper svn:externals.

If you are worried about stability, check out a specific revision by
putting -r (revision number) in between log and https
