flumotion (0.4.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * The format of the configuration for managers ("<planet>") changed in
    versions 0.3.2 and 0.4.1.  The configuration for the default manager will
    be automatically upgraded *after* the normal dpkg upgrade process and a
    backup of the previous version will be saved as:
        /etc/flumotion/managers/default/planet.pre-0.4.1-backup.xml

    If you need to upgrade more configuration files, you should do so manually
    with the help of the provided XSLT stylesheet; you should run a command
    such as the following one as root:
        # su -s /bin/sh flumotion -c \
            "xsltproc /usr/share/flumotion/upgrade-to-0.4.1.xsl \
                 /etc/flumotion/managers/default/planet.xml"

flumotion (0.2.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Previous flumotion versions used to allow any login/password by default, but
  this fails by default now.  The default configuration file,
  /etc/flumotion/managers/default/planet.xml, now adds an account named "user"
  with password "test" which you may use instead.

flumotion (0.2.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  The XML config format was changed for components.  They should now list
  each of their properties in a
  <property name="propname"> section instead of just having
  <propname></propname>.  Also, the <feed> nodes are gone.

  This must also be done in the manager section where it's using a bouncer
  component.

  You can upgrade your planet config files using xsltproc and the
  included stylesheet:

      xsltproc /usr/share/flumotion/upgrade-to-0.2.0.xsl planet.xml > new.xml
