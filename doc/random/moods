- components have moods
- moods reflect a "state" the component is in
- examples:
  - LOST:     no heartbeat received lately; component locked up, died, or
              network problem
  - HUNGRY:   waiting for a dependency to start (e.g., a feed, or other comp)
  - HAPPY:    everything fine, component working, received heartbeats
  - SAD:      an error happened (we wanted to use ANGRY, but the difference
              between ANGRY and HUNGRY is close to non-existent in French)
  - WAKING:   a component started up and is preparing
  - SLEEPING: exists but not yet asked to do something
 
- the "mood" is decided in the manager; for example, a component that is LOST
  could be locked up and doesn't know itself that it is lost !
- connected admins use a remotecacheable object for the component that has
  the mood 
- component lifecycle:
  - gets created -> "WAKING"
  - manager calls "start" -> component goes to HUNGRY, SAD, or HAPPY
