RUNNING FLUMOTION AS A SERVICE
------------------------------

* a launcher script called flumotion
* used by the rc.d service script
* parses the flumotion sysconfdir
* which contains
  manager/
    flumotion.pem, SSL PEM file for communication
     FIXME: rename to correspond with "default" in planets ?
    htpasswd, crypt passwords for logging in to manager
  planets/
    default.xml: a planet with only a manager and bouncer
  flows/
    *.xml: a planet with a flow, and possibly atmosphere

(FIXME: workers don't really have a config concept, nor should they be
 in a planet since they're outside
  workers/
    mirroring files in planets/ by default

  planetarium/
    when they are here, they link managers to flows

* launcher flumotion script:
  - check for planetarium/
    (not supported yet),
    get list of managers
  - for each manager in planets/:
    - take all flows from flows/ belonging to it
     - start up manager with planets/default.xml and all flows/*.xml files,
      which will be merged on the fly
     - start up a worker as well if the sysconf file allows it
