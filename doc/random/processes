Some notes about process management
-----------------------------------

- In general, processes can be told to shut down:
  - on explicit user request (UI, send a message, ...)
  - on explicit program request (pb shutdown message, ...)
  - reception of SIGINT (e.g. ctrl-C)
  - reception of SIGTERM (the default "kill" signal)
  - reception of SIGKILL (handled by the kernel, never received by process)

- A worker spawns job processes, and these job processes can also be told
  to shut down, and should do so in a sensible way.

- When the main worker process is told to shut down, it should also make sure
  all of its job children shut down correctly.

Job processes
-------------
- should:
  - have a SIGINT handler that stops the component
  - have a SIGTERM handler that stops the component
  - have a worker brain-callable method to shut down nicely
