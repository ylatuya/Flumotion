It's sometimes useful to be able to run some (but not all) jobs that a flumotion
worker is running under valgrind.

If you want to do this, run the worker with the environment variable
FLU_VALGRIND_JOB set. It takes a comma-seperated list of component avatar IDs,
and will run all of these under valgrind with the arguments
 --leak-check=full --num-callers=24 --leak-resolution=high --show-reachable=yes
