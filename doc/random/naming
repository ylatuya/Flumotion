NAMING of OBJECTS
-----------------

- component:
  - has a name, componentName
    - name is unique within the parent
    - component is child of a flow or the atmosphere
  - componentId:
    - /(parentName)/(componentName)
    - unique within the manager

- flow:
  - cannot be named "atmosphere"

- feed:
  - has a feedName, unique within the set of feeded feeds in a component;
    (in code/config where it's not explicitly specified, it defaults to
     "default")
    (Note, there could be an eater eating a feed with the same name, coming
     from a different component.  Don't key both eaters and feeders in a
     component on only the feedName !)
  - has a feedId, which is unique in the flow
    (componentName):(feedName)
  - ? has a fullFeedId, which is unique in the manager:
    (componentId):(feedName), or
    /(parentName)/(componentName)/(feedName)

- elements:
  - eater: has an element name
      eater:(feedId), or eater:(componentName):(feedName)
      where componentName is the name of the component *producing* the feed

  - feeder: same, but with feeder: prefix
      and componentName is the name of the component this feeder is part of

- feedserver:
  - allows feedclients to eat from a feeder or feed to an eater accessible
    through the feedserver
  - to eat from a feeder, all you need is the fullFeedId:
    - componentId identifies the actual component (since a feedserver can
      be serving for multiple flows, the parentName is also needed)
    - feedName identifies the feed being fed
  - to feed to an eater, you need:
    - componentId of the component you want to feed to
    - feedId of the feed being fed
