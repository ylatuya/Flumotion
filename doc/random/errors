Error handling in Flumotion
---------------------------

GOALS
-----
- admin clients should be able to see warnings and errors about components

NOTES
-----
- a component collects error objects in its state in the manager;
  these are serializable to the admin client
- stopping a component clears the error objects
- the error objects should be translated in the admin client's language
  -> translation happens in the client
- error objects should contain:
  - a domain enum
  - an error enum in the domain
  - a non-translated translatable user-showable string
  - possibly extra debug info (non-translated)

- manager that asks a worker or component to do something and receiving a
  failure should create an error object from this
- for a component, it should attach it to the componentstate
