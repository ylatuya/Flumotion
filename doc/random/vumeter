The return time is the time interval between the
removal of a steady-state input signal (normally
corresponding to the reference indication) and the
moment when the indication passes a specified
lower threshold of the scale. The return time shall
be 1,7 s ± 0,3 s if the lower point is 20 dB below
reference indication. The return speed should be
approximately constant. On instruments intended
for monitoring multichannel programmes, the
difference in return time should be less than 0,1 s.
When the maximum level is indicated on a
numerical indicator or in a special mode of the
incremental display, the hold time shall
be 1,0 s ± 0,5 s.
