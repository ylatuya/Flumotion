* Pick a new version number and set it for the rest of the commands:
  export VERSION=0.6.2
* Choose release name:
  - a bar for micro version
  - a restaurant for minor version
* add a revision to the .doap file for the next version
* Check for milestone bugs
  example:
  https://core.fluendo.com/flumotion/trac/report/16?format=tab&MILESTONE=$VERSION
* create the release notes in the flumotion.net modules:
  - in src/htdocs/releases/flumotion, create a new file
  - add it to Makefile.am
  - update list of features by going through the ChangeLog
  - update list of bugs fixed by pasting in the output of:
    moap doap bug query -f "<bug><id>%(id)s</id><summary>%(summary)s</summary></bug>" milestone=$VERSION

  - update list of contributors
* copy the generated text version to the RELEASE file
* Edit NEWS and add the tickets fixed for this milestone, as well as the
  new features
  (if this is a new major/minor stable series, list features for the whole
   development cycle, not since last dev release, as users are typically
   upgrading from the previous stable series)
* bump nano in configure.ac to 0
* update doap file, adding new release
* edit ChangeLog and add === release $VERSION ===
* commit to SVN
* create release tag:
  svn cp https://svn.fluendo.com/svn/flumotion/trunk https://svn.fluendo.com/svn/flumotion/tags/flumotion-$VERSION
* do a fresh checkout of the just created release tag:
  svn co https://svn.fluendo.com/svn/flumotion/tags/flumotion-$VERSION
* enter that checkout
* make release
* copy release tarball (.bz2 and .gz) and md5 to flumotion.net/data/src/flumotion, and upload
  using bin/data-put
* build documentation from flumotion-doc and upload it (remember to svn up flumotion-doc first!)
  svn up
  ../flumotion-$VERSION/env ./autogen
  ../flumotion-$VERSION/env make
  ../flumotion-$VERSION/env make pdf
* fix up ticket list to do and milestone (trac)

  Example: from the tag, do 
    moap doap -v $VERSION mail -f msmith@fluendo.com flumotion-devel@lists.fluendo.com theora@xiph.org
* submit release to freshmeat:
  moap doap -v $VERSION freshmeat
* update the jhbuild modules in misc/flu.*.modules to point at the latest release tag
