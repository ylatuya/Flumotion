Scheduled Playlists
-------------------

We parse a simple XML format, consisting of a top-level <playlist> element,
containing one or more <entry> elements.

Each <entry> has two mandatory and two optional attributes:
  filename - the file to use. May be relative, in which case it will be 
             interpreted relative to some configured location
  time     - the time at which to start playing the file, a UTC timestamp
             in the format YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sZ (an ISO 8601 format), see
             below for examples.
  offset   - optional, defaults to zero. The offset (in seconds, fractional 
             seconds permitted) from the start of the media file to begin
             playback at the given time.
  duration - optional, defaults to the length of the file minus the offset. 
             The duration, in seconds, of playback from the file. 
             If duration + offset is greater than the length of the actual file,
             it will be clamped to the actual length - offset.

If times and durations (explicit or implicit) cause any overlap to occur, the
earlier entry will be truncated to allow the later ones to begin on time.

Whenever any part of the timeline has no scheduled or available data, video
will be replaced by black, audio by silence. 

Timestamps:
 ISO 8601 Combined Date/Time Format, UTC.
 YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sZ

 Example: 19th April 2007, 3:15:20.38pm UTC is written:
   2007-04-19T15:15:20.38Z
 Similarly, 17th May 2007, 8:20:18am Central European Summer Time (UTC+2) is
 written as (note the 06; we convert to UTC for this):
   2007-05-17T06:20:18Z

Sample file (single entry):

<playlist>
  <entry filename="customer/file/movie.ogg" time="2007-04-19T15:15:20.38Z" 
         offset="0" duration="120.45"/>
</playlist>
