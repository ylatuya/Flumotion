This file documents the protocol used by the component base classes to
produce initialized components. These descriptions are not the only
tasks that the methods perform, but they are the documented points of
extensibility. An alternate (overridden) implementation of these methods
must perform the named tasks.

For more information on object protocols, see

Entry points
============

A component object gets created using a factory function.
This factory function is called the "entry point" of a component type.
This entry point is declared in the registry section for that component type.

The manager invokes the worker's remote_create() method.
The worker then spawns a job to run this component in.
It calls the factory function with the config dictionary as the sole argument.

In practice all components in flumotion's repository are set to have the
component class as an entry point. This allows the __init__ in the
BaseComponent class to handle entry point requests. To allow for
extensibility, there is a protocol that __init__ is expected to follow
to initialize the component.

Implementations
---------------

BaseComponent.__init__(self)
----------------------------
This method is expected to produce an initialized component.
It should do as little as possible, and not access any resources,
config, ... because it does not yet have a connection to the manager
to report state through.

The implementation calls every init() method of any of the subclasses
in the hierarchy.

BaseComponent.setup(self, config, *args, **kwargs)
---------------------------------
Invoked by manager through medium.
sets self.config
Must configure any plugs specified in config. This involves loading
their bundles, instantiating the plugs, and adding them to lists on the
dict stored in the self.plugs attribute.
Invokes do_check() vmethod, which returns a deferred.
When this deferred succeeds, invokes do_setup() vmethod, which
also returns a deferred.
If any of these fail, this method also raises
flumotion.common.errors.ComponentSetupError() and does not proceed to
do_setup()

returns the original deferred.

BaseComponent.start(self, *args, **kwargs)
------------------------------------------
Sets mood to waking.
Must start any plugs specified in the config, which means calling their
start() method.
Invokes do_start(), which returns a deferred.
Any errors encountered during start() should return a Failure so the remote
call fails.
Any errors encountered after this step should be proxied through state
messages.
Returns the deferred.

BaseComponent.stop(self)
-------------------------
Sets mood to waking.
Invokes do_stop(), which returns a deferred.
After the deferred fires, must stop all plugs.
Returns the deferred.

Interface
---------

BaseComponent.init(self)
------------------------
Subclasses should declare instance variables, ...
All .init methods of every class in the hierarchy get called.
This method is optional for subclasses.

BaseComponent.do_check(self)
----------------------------
This method has no requirements. It is implementation-specific.
It can be used to check various requirements, or known bugs in certain
versions of software.
If this method adds any error messages to the component state, this will
automatically trigger a mood change to sad and raise a ComponentSetupError.
If there is a fatal problem that can't be expressed with a message, this
method should go to sad and raise ComponentSetupError itself.
If there is nothing, or only warnings, the method should return a result.
After this call, the component should be ready to set up.

BaseComponent.do_setup(self, *args, **kwargs)
----------------------------
This method has no requirements. It is implementation-specific.
After this call, the component should have created all resources and
be ready to start.

BaseComponent.do_start(self, *args, **kwargs)
---------------------------------------------
Implementations should make sure that a succesful start sets the mood to
happy.

BaseComponent.do_stop(self)
---------------------------
Implementations should make sure that a succesful stop sets the mood to
sleeping.


Feed components
===============

A feed component is a component that has a pipeline. Its initialization
protocol provides a mechanism for creating and initializing the
pipeline.

Implementations
---------------

FeedComponent.do_setup(self, eatersData, feedersData)
-------------------------
This method will instantiate a pipeline first, and set up the eaters' and
feeders' hostnames and ports then allow the object a chance to do any further
initialization after the pipeline is created.
It does this by calling the following two methods:

  FeedComponent.create_pipeline(self)
  FeedComponent.set_pipeline(self, pipeline)

Interface
---------

FeedComponent.create_pipeline(self)
-----------------------------------
This method should return a GstPipeline object. It is a pure virtual
method.

FeedComponent.set_pipeline(self, pipeline)
------------------------------------------
The base implementation of this method will set self.pipeline to
pipeline and will connect to signals, the bus, etc. Subclass
implementations should chain up to this method first.


Parse-launch components
=======================

Parse-launch components construct their pipelines via strings. This
protocol provides a mechanism whereby subclasses have a convenient
interface for producing these strings, and for configuring themselves
once the pipeline is created.

Implementation
--------------

ParseLaunchComponent.create_pipeline(self)
------------------------------------------
Calls the following method:

  ParseLaunchComponent.get_pipeline_string(self, properties)

ParseLaunchComponent.set_pipeline(self, pipeline)
-------------------------------------------------
Chains up to the parent, then calls the following method:

  ParseLaunchComponent.configure_pipeline(self, pipeline, properties)

Interface
---------

ParseLaunchComponent.get_pipeline_string(self, properties)
----------------------------------------------------------
Must return a string, the pipeline template. Properties is a dict from
self.config['properties'] (i.e., the component properties, without the
name, type, parent, etc.). Pure virtual.

ParseLaunchComponent.configure_pipeline(self, pipeline, properties)
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Called so that subclasses can manipulate the pipeline directly if
needed. Defaults to doing nothing.
