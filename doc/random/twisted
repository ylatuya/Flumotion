Twisted programming notes
-------------------------

Failures
--------
- errbacks that "handle" the failure and don't want further errbacks should
  return None
- errbacks that want to reraise the failure just return failure;
  a failure that gets returned from a remote server to a different remote
  client will print a superfluous twisted line:
  Traceback from remote host -- Traceback unavailable
- use which = failure.trap(list of exceptions) to catch multiple known
- use failure.check() to switch on the type and have a general fallback
- use failure.getErrorMessage() to print a readable message
- use failure.value to get the value the original exception was created with
- use failure.type to get the class of exception this failure wraps
