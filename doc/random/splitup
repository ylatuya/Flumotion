The various chunks of code need to be split up a little differently to
support the bundle-ability of flumotion.

There are four kinds of code files:
- base: used by more than one flumotion process, not bundle-able
  (ie. code to distribute and unpack bundles, ...)
  this contains bootstrap code
- manager/admin/worker: process-specific code, not bundle-able

- common: code used both by manager "as-is" and bundle-able to others
  (ie keycards, ...)

- everything else: bundle-able code

FIXME: maybe shared and bundled can go in the same directory; stuff from
       shared can also be bundled so bundled is not a good name

-> base, private, shared, bundled

On the file system, these should be four different subtrees, each containing
"flumotion" as the base entry directory.

Inside these subtrees, they should also go in separate packages completely.

In a development tree, they should also be separate.
- manager would put base, shared, and private on its import path
- worker, admin would put base and private on its import path,
  and have shared and bundled through bundles

Installed:
- under libdir/flumotion
- three/four different subdirs
- partitioned tree under them
- remove python from path
