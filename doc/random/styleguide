FLUMOTION STYLE GUIDE
---------------------

UI
--

- use kbit/s and Mbit/s
- provide accelerators for controls

API DOCS
--------
- We use epydoc and epydoc markup for API docs
- list @param before @type: what it actually does is more useful to know
  than the type
- align the var/param name:
  @param name:
  @type  name:
- align the content after the colons within a block
- types are "str" and "bool", not string or boolean
- separate @param from @rtype/@returns with an empty line
- .callRemote calls and similar are interfaces between processes.
  They should be documented with care, and it is good to add explain
  how they get received on the other side, linking to the receiving object
  base class
- defer_generator_method screws up the docs for public methods, leaving them
  without a docstring.  Avoid using defer_generator_method in public methods.
- defer_generator_method screws up the docs for private methods, causing
  private methods to be listed in the public API.  Avoid using
  defer_generator_method in private methods.
