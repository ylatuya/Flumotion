Style Guide for Python Code [1] document.

ChangeLog
=========

All checkins should add an appropriate entry in the ChangeLog.
Exceptions for repository ignore files and metadata.

Tests
=====

To be able to archive good quality of the code, all major checkins
should also add an appropriate test in the testsuite. It's not okay
to have any tests in a non-working tests when checking in. The testsuite
should *always* run with no failing tests and ideally with no output.
This also makes it easier to refactor code.

If large changes are made over many places in the tree which can't make
the whole testsuite run, then it should be made on a separate branch and
not be merged with the main trunk before everything passes and it has been
reviewed.

Naming
======
- classes should be named with CapitalizedWords
- methods and functions should be named in the same style as the libraries
  on the same interface level
  e.g. GStreamer, GObject and GTK+ subclasses with underscore_method,
  but Twisted-style classes with lowerCamelCaseMethod
  When these two conflict, prefer lowerCamelCaseMethod
  In general, Flumotion follows lowerCamelCaseMethod
  This goes for regular functions too
- some Twisted-style methods have a special form of (action)_lowerCamelCase;
  e.g. perspective_, remote_, do_
