A scenario sits between wizard and its wizard steps
It takes care of fetching the state of the steps and doing something
useful to it, eg present next step in case of wizards.

Basic scenario

Welcome
  -> Source

Source
  if has_video
     get step from combobox_video
   else if has_audio
     get step from combobox_audio

VideoSource (for TVCard, FireWire, Webcam, TestVideoSource)
  -> Overlay

Overlay
  if Source option has_video is true
    get Source option audio
    if Soundcard is selected
      -> Soundcard
    else
      -> Test Audio Source

Soundcard
  -> Encoding

Encoding
  # video "algorithm"
  if Source option has_video is true
    if combobox_video is theora
      -> Theora
    else if it is smoke
      -> Smoke
    else if it is JPEG
      -> JPEG
  # audio "algorithm"
  else if Source option has_audio is true
    if combobox_audio is vorbis
      -> Vorbis
    else if it is Speex
      -> Speex
    else if it is Mulaw
      -> Consumption
  else
    -> Consumption

VideoEncoding (for Theora, Smoke, JPEG)
  -> Use audio algorithm from Encoding
    
AudioEncoder (for Vorbis, Speex)
  -> Consumption

Consumption (for all HTTP and Disk)
  Very complex algorithm, see flumotion/wizard/steps.py
