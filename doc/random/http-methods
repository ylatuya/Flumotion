gnome-vfs 2.6.0 broke the server because it was broken.

To be able to get the content type of a stream it did the following

	PROPFIND / HTTP/1.1

	HEAD / HTTP/1.1

It can be tested by running

  $ gnomevfs-info url

However, this broke because we used to send all the data, despiteless of
the request. So currently we support the following http commands:

	GET		Prints headers and raw data
	HEAD		Prints headers
	PROPFIND	Set 405 error (Not allowed)

We need to investigate what other methods we'd like to support.
