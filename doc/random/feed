Notes about FeedComponents and how they connect
-----------------------------------------------
- a FeedComponent has a simple interface; on top of the usual
  BaseComponent protocol, it adds two methods:
  feedToFD(self, feedName, fd)
  eatFromFD(self, feedId, fd)
- a user of a FeedComponent (a Medium, or whatever flumotion-launch uses)
  is responsible for callling feedToFD on component1 eatFromFD on component2
  to connect a feeder to an eater
- a worker has an FPB.ServerFactory to expose feeds of its components over
the network
- through this server, a reference to a FeedAvatar can be obtained;
  on this reference, sendFeed and receiveFeed can be remote-called
  - this will result in the PB connection's underlying socket to be used
    for actual GStreamer data passing
- the FeedServer needs to pass the fd of this connection through the
  worker-job PB connection to the correct job
- connection between a feeder and an eater can be made initially in both
  directions

Connecting downstream (from feeder to eater):
---------------------------------------------
- see feed-eatfrom.svg
- in the manager, ComponentAvatar.eatFrom(fullFeedId, host, port) is called
  on the component avatar whose eater it wants to connect
  (remote call (1))
- the job-side FeedComponentMedium will login to the remote FeedServer
  that has the feeder for the given fullFeedId, then call sendFeed
  (remote call (2))
- the FeedAvatar of the remote worker will respond by calling sendFeedReply
  (remote call (3))
  the eater's FeedMedium will stop reading from the transport, then callLater
  (to allow the return value to be proxied back to the feeder's FeedAvatar)
  to flush, stopWriting, and hand off the FD to the component
  the feeder's FeedAvatar will, when it gets the reply from (3),
  stop reading and writing from the transport.  Then it takes the fd,
  and sends an fd-passing message over the worker->job PB connection.
  The JobMedium receives the message, and calls feedToFD() on the component
- at this point, the feeder and the eater are both connected, and the eater
  will receive the stream from the feeder
