.SH DESCRIPTION
.B flumotion-worker
is the part of flumotion that actually performs all the real work of encoding,
streaming, etc. In a flumotion system, there will be a single manager, and could
be several workers running on different systems (this is useful to distribute
the load of, for instance, video encoding). You need to have a minimum of one
worker for flumotion to function correctly.

You should start flumotion-manager first, then connect flumotion-worker to the
running manager.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-h, --help"
Show a brief help message, then exit.
.IP "--version"
Show the version number.
.IP "-v, --verbose"
Be verbose in console output.
.IP "-dDEBUG, --debug=DEBUG"
Set the debug configuration to the specified 
.B debug
string. See the
.I Debugging
section for details of this.
.IP "-HHOST, --hostname=HOST"
Specify the hostname on which the manager is running.
.IP "-PPORT, --port=PORT"
Specify the port on which the manager in running (usually 7531 for SSL, or
8642 otherwise)
.IP "-TTRANSPORT, --transport=TRANSPORT"
Set the transport protocol to use, either 'tcp' or 'ssl'. Default is 'ssl'.
.IP "-CCERTIFICATE, --certificate=CERTIFICATE"
Specify the PEM certificate file to use. This is required if you use SSL.
.IP "-nNAME, --name=NAME"
Set the name for this worker to use in the manager.
.IP "-D, --daemonize"
Run in the background as a daemon.
.IP "-u, --username"
Specify the username to use to connect to the manager.
.IP "-p, --password"
Specify the password to use to connect to the manager.
.IP "-FPORTS, --feederports=PORTS
Specify the range of feeder ports to use in the format 'lower-upper'. These are
the ports used for inter-worker communication. If you have multiple workers on
seperate systems (perhaps one doing encoding, behind a firewall, and a second
doing the streaming outside the firewall), they must be able to communicate
using this port range, so you'll have to open these ports in your firewall. It
is recommended that you have a range of 20 ports.
