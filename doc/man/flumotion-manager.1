.SH DESCRIPTION
.B flumotion-manager
is the central management component of the flumotion streaming server.
.B flumotion-manager
does not actually perform any streaming or encoding itself, it simply 
acts as a central point for
.I flumotion-worker
instances
and
.I flumotion-admin
administration consoles to connect to. You need to start it before any other
flumotion component. When starting flumotion-manager, you need only specify a
.I planet configuration file
, but it is frequently helpful to set other options from the command line.

.B flumotion-manager
can load multiple configuration files, if more than one is specified. These are
loaded in order, and merged into a single configuration. This allows you to have
one configuration file specify the basic manager configuration, such as 
authentication configuration, and have a second specify the streaming 
configuration.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-h, --help"
Show a brief help message, then exit.
.IP "--version"
Show the version number.
.IP "-v, --verbose"
Be verbose in console output. This is equivalent to setting the debug level to
3, and will override any debug specifiers.
.IP "-dDEBUG, --debug=DEBUG"
Set the debug configuration to the specified 
.B debug
string. See the
.I Debugging
section for details of this.
.IP "-HHOST, --hostname=HOST"
Specify the interface to bind to, either as a hostname or a numeric address.
Usually, unless you have multiple network connections, you won't want to set
this at all. Defaults to binding to all interfaces.
.IP "-PPORT, --port=PORT"
Set the port the manager should listen on. Default is 7531 if SSL is being used,
or 8642 otherwise.
.IP "-TTRANSPORT, --transport=TRANSPORT"
Set the transport protocol to use, either 'tcp' or 'ssl'. Default is 'ssl'.
.IP "-CCERTIFICATE, --certificate=CERTIFICATE"
Specify the PEM certificate file to use. This is required if you use SSL.
.IP "-nNAME, --name=NAME"
Set the manager name.
.IP "-D, --daemonize"
Run in the background as a daemon.

.SH DEBUGGING

In the unlikely event of something in flumotion not working, you might want to
debug it. The flumotion tools (
.B flumotion-worker
,
.B flumotion-admin
, and
.B flumotion-manager
) all alow you to turn on debugging output in two different ways.

Firstly, you can use an environment variable, FLU_DEBUG. Secondly, you can
launch the program with a -d or --debug switch. Either approach allows you to
specify a debug configuration string with the following syntax:

.RS
.B name1:n1,name2:n2,name3:n3
.RE

In this syntax, the 'name' variables can be replaced with the name of a 
particular module within flumotion (such as 'admin', 'twisted', etc.). You can 
also use '*' to specify all modules. The 'n' variables are numbers from 1 to 5,
larger numbers corresponding to more verbose output (ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG, 
and LOG). At level 4, full debugging information is emitted. 

You can also use an abbreviated form where you just supply a single number, thisuses that debug level for all modules. Thus the simplest way to enable full
debug output for all modules is to use '-d 4' on the command line.

A more complex example would be '-d *:3,admin:4' to set the logging level for
the admin module to DEBUG, and for all other modules to INFO.

.SH EXAMPLES

Simple example, starting flumotion-manager using TCP, in verbose mode:

.RS
flumotion-manager -v -T tcp conf/managers/default/planet.xml
.RE

A slightly more complex example, using two different configuration files and
running in the background:

.RS
flumotion-manager -T tcp -D conf/managers/default/planet.xml conf/managers/mystream.xml
